## The Supermarket Checkout Kata in TypeScript

This is a variation of a popular kata described in
http://codekata.com/kata/kata01-supermarket-pricing/.
The aim of the exercise is to build an automated checkout that can scan articles from
a shopping cart and produce a receipt.

The supermarket has a catalogue with different types of products (rice, apples, milk, toothbrushes,...).
Each product has a price, and the total price of the shopping cart is the total of all the prices.

But the supermarket also runs special deals, for example:

- Buy two toothbrushes, get one free
- 10% discount on rice
- 20% discount on apples if you buy more than 10
- Bags of 1 kg of oranges £4 instead of £5.

These are just examples: the actual special deals change each week, so need to be easily configurable.

### Goal

The goal of the exercise is to implement a `Checkout` that can handle the following scenarios (and more - use your imagination!):

- The checkout should be able to handle a shopping cart with no special deals
- The client should get a receipt with the list of purchases and the total price.
- The teller should be able to handle the following special deals:
  - Buy 2 get one free
  - Buy 4 get one free
  - 10% discount on a certain product (e.g. 10% discount on 1kg packets of rice)
  - 20% discount on a certain product if you buy more than 10 (e.g 20% discount on apples for 11 or more apples)
  - Fixed discounts (e.g. bag of 1kg of oranges costs £4 instead of £5).
- The system can be configured with multiple different special deals,
  so the teller should be able to correctly detect and apply all the special deals applicable to a given shopping cart.
  To keep things simple you can assume that there will be up to one deal per product category.

There is a simple failing test in `spec/checking_out.spec.ts` to get you started.

### Running the tests

The tests that you'll find under `spec` directory are written using the jest framework and can be executed as follows:

- to run the tests once, run the following command:

```
npm test
```

- to re-run the tests automatically as soon as you save your changes, run:

```
npm run test:watch
```
